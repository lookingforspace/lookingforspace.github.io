## Starting Point

This is my <s>first blog's post</s> here.

nothing special.



i have make so many blog site before.

but nothing worth mentioned.

cause it just a bunch of empty blog'.



i have never write a good article too.

there are no update every week.



there is just one or two post for every blog i ever made.

a first post with so much confident, so much planning..

but in the end .. the blog's are destined to die after one or two more post..


ah what's wrong..

i don't know either


so i decided to make this blog..

with no planing at all, just follow what will happen in the future.. (isn't it called a plan too? haha whatever)


just write what i want to write ..


let see if this blog gonna have the same fate like all my previous blog.


ps: my english is so broke so feel free to correct it.

edit-2020: this note was written back in my last blog in 2018, i decided to move to my new blog so i can delete my old blog.
